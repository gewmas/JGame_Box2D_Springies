Link to team repository: https://github.com/duke-compsci308-fall2013/springies_team09

Roles in project: We each wrote parts of the parser, object, and force classes.

Files used to start project: https://github.com/duke-compsci308-fall2013/springies

Resources used: Talked to TAs (Jonno, Kevin, and Rachel) about some of the smaller details

Data or resource files needed: All files used to test program can be found in data file in repository.

Information about program: 'N' allows you to load a new model.'C' clears all objects off the display. 'G' toggles gravity. 'V' toggles viscosity. 'M' toggles center of mass force. '1', '2', '3', and '4' toggle their respective wall repulsion forces. The up key increases the thickness of the walls while the down key does the opposite.

Known issues: Objects are still able to go through walls if they acquire enough velocity.

Extra features: The color of each model in the environment can be toggled using the 'D' key. There are force status messages on the left of the screen. Holding down the 'B' key displays the bounding boxes of all the objects on the screen.

Impressions: Some of instructions/descriptions of objects and forces on the website were a bit ambiguous.
